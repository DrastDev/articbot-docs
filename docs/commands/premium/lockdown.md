# Lockdown
Lockdown is a simple feature to lock down a channel so that any user other than a Moderator or Administrator can't type messages in a certain channel. This can help when conversation's get heated, command channels are getting spammed, or you are simply getting information overload.

!!! warning
    There is currently no way to cancel a lockdown, so once a lockdown has been initiated, it will be in place until the timer you set end's. A feature to end the lockdown early is being implemented.

## Syntax
`$lockdown [time](d)(h)(m)(s)`
