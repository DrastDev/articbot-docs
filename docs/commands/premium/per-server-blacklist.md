# Per-Server Blacklist
ArticBot has a built in global blacklist, to prevent user's on a global scale from using commands, however, situations may arise when you need to block users just on your guild.

!!! warning
    If you feel a user should be globally blacklisted, please join our support server [here](https://discord.gg/ZBYN5uB) and submit a request.

## Syntax
To blacklist a user:
`$ps-blacklist [user] (reason)`
To un-blacklist a user:
`$ps-rblacklist [user]`
